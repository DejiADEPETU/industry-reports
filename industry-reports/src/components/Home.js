                Today is AI debates are searching for principles to govern emerging and future tech-
                nological systems for the common good. If the “good” involves upholding human
                dignity, then the international human rights system is fit for purpose. If AI researchers,
                developers, and designers work to protect and respect fundamental human rights,
                they could open the path for broad social benefit. To disregard human rights would be
                to close off that path.
